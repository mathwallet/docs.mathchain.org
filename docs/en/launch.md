The roadmap of MathChain launch:

Phase 0 - MathChain Galois

The testnet of MathChain.

Phase 1 - MathChain Pos

In this phase MathChain will launch with POS Consensus and mainly focus of the secret node function development and smart wallet development.

Phase 2 - MathChain Thread

In this phase MathChain will connect to Polkadot RelayChain through para-thread. As in the beginning phase the transaction volume is low but as a wallet appchain it needs highest security level.

Phase 3 - MathChain Para

In this phase MathChain will connect to Polkadot RelayChain through para-slot. With more and more applications merge with smart wallet users, MathChain will auction a para-chain slot to improve the transaction performance.
